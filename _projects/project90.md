Leveraging deep learning techniques for autonomous driving, including YOLO, DETIC for object detection (cars, road signs, traffic signals), Marigold for monocular depth estimation, OSX for pedestrian pose estimation and mask RCNN for lane detection and classification and RAFT for optical flow to create a 3D representation of the driving scene. Integrated this data into Blender for visualization.
