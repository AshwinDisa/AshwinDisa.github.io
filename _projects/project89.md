In this project, we recreate the seminal Victoria Park SLAM demonstration, in which a truck equipped with a laser range finder traverses an Australian park, collecting range and bearing measurements to nearby trees. These measurements are fused with an Ackermann-steering kinematic model of the vehicle to simultaneously localize the truck and map the positions of the tree landmarks.
