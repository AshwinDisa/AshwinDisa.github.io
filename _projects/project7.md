Abstractâ€”This project aims to plan a path for multiple robots simultaneously by treating the robots as a single composite system with many degrees of freedom, known as centralized multi-robot planning. The plan is to utilize dRRT (discrete Rapidly Exploring Random Tree) algorithm over preplanned single robot PRM (Probabilistic Roadmap) graphs. Instead of doing a tree search over the entire cartesian workspace and performing expensive collision checks over and over again, we are planning over a environment-collision free state subset obtained via the tensor product of individual robot PRMs.
