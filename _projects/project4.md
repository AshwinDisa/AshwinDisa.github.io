_Abstract_ â€” Landing is a crucial maneuver for a successful
flight mission. This paper presents vision-based ground marker
detection and autonomous landing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs). The methodology is based on a monocular vision system
that detects the predefined ground marker and determines the
altitude of the UAV solely from the vision sensor data. The same
vision system is also used for positioning and estimating the
orientation of the UAV with respect to the ground marker. A
proportional controller is implemented for landing the UAV accu-
rately. Image Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) control technique is
implemented to reduce the computational cost of the system. The
algorithm accounts for abnormal situations such as loss of ground
marker in the image frame or a partially visible ground marker.
The performance of the landing system is verified through both
simulations and outdoor experimentation. The results show the
accuracy and robustness of the proposed autonomous landing
strategy.
